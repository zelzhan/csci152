My solutions to the Performance and Data Structure course

COURSE OVERVIEW

Students will learn about common abstract data types such as stacks, queues, sets, and maps, study how they can be utilized to solve different problems, and implement them using the Java language.  The pros and cons of using different internal representations such as arrays, linked-lists, binary search trees, and hash tables will be examined.  Students will be required to assess problems and choose appropriate data structures and relevant algorithms to improve performance and understand the practical limits of computability.

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this course,

Students will understand the concept of abstract data types (ADTs), and how they are supported by the interface construct in the Java language;
Students will be familiar with the most important ADTs used in the storage and retrieval of information in modern software systems, including stack, queue, set, and map.
Students will be able to design and implement these ADTs using both static memory (i.e., arrays) and dynamic methods;
Students will be able to examine the relative performance of the data structures, and the scalability of the structures as the size of data sets increases;
Students will be able to develop and test the data structures using component-based software engineering techniques;
Students will understand basic object-oriented concepts, such as inheritance and polymorphism, though their implementation and use of ADTs in the Java language.
